This is my first attempt to keep a record of the changes I make to the files, in 
case I mess up, of for the next grad student victim of this code.

2008 04 04--Magically, from nothing working, I've managed to validate the two 
            simplest cases: single-sided and crozz vent (2 sections, no heat 
            loads). It was validated with both a Maple code I wrote, and CONTAM.
          --I changed the formula to obtain density, from 
            1.205*(1.0+(20.0-this.air_temp)/(273.0+(20.0+this.air_temp)/2.0))
            to 
            287.05/101325.0*(this.air_temp+273.15)
            I've compared them both, and they differ little. Only that the 
            second formula involves less calculations --at least in Maple--, and
            comes directly from the eq of state for ideal gases (as opposed to 
            the original one, which is an extrapolation. R(dry air) = 287.05 J/KgK
            1 atm = 101325 Pa, T[Kelvin] = temp+273.15
          --For the moment single sided vent has all the heatloads in Zone1, and
            none in Zone2.

2008 04 05--Corrected the good old error with cross vent + thermal mass. It was 
            in input read, while definind the TMasses. Now all simulation works :)

2008 04 06--I removed the Math.random term from CV's initial temperature and all
            (TM, Transient) works. :)
          --It turns out that the simulation time is shorter than my thermal 
            mass' time constant, and therefore I'm getting and effect of time in
            steady state simulations. I don't know how to modify the simulation
            time. 
               I tried changing the temp_error threshold from 1e-7 to 1e-9
                and it didn't work.
               I tried changing the stady state controller from 8000 to 80000
                and in worked!!! It is a longer calculation, but for a controller
                of 34,000 I reach steady state.

2008 04 13--While preparing for the Energy Showcase I realized that nightcooling 
            wasn't working anymore. I have no clue why. When I first implemented
            it, the code would go through certain calflowrate function , and now 
            it goes through another. So I fixed it now, but I need to be alert at
            why this change in functions happened. To fix it, I aded a *openingfrac
`           at the end of the florate calculation line, in the Calculation file.

2008 04 14--I've changed the values for discharge coefficient, to account for flow
            through doors. For that I had to add the location "Door" to the flowpath
            class. 

2008 07 16--A few weeks ago I worked on implementing radiation back into the code 
            (on a much simpler way than Jinchao), simply by separating the heat
            gains in radiative and convective. Now heat loads are calculated 
            separately, and the idea is that solar heat gains heat up the walls
            as opposed of heating up the air, as it was initially set up. 
            I've ran a few tests, using only radiative and only convective, and 
            there are differences, I can't really tell if it's working 100% though.

            I found out that the code was going through some lines (in the
            calAir_temp_trapezoidal section of Define_network) that were supposed
            to be activated only when on radiant mode. I've removed those lines
            but this means that the code was going though them all the time in the
            past. Not good. I have not figured out a way of accurately comparing 
            results from one run to the other.

2008 08 27--I've just added what I call radiative heat to the model, in the correct
            line this time (define_network, cal_temp_trapezoidal). And it works!!
            I've also figured out how to read the TemperatureOutput.txt file :)
            First columns correspond to temperature of each zone, next columns 
            correspond to each thermal mass element.

2008 08 28--I'm playing around with the Occupational fraction being radiated versus
            convected. I've left it all convected until I really understand whether
            the usual 70W per person is only convective heat load, or corresponds 
            to all. The default coefficient for convection (0.2) just seems too low.
            I've modified the characteristics of TMasses, so that only the upper
            layer (ie floor) receives the solar heat.

2008 08 29--Ok, so I changed the radiative coeff to 0.5, following HoF 05 30.14, I've
            tested it and it's working. I've also modified the code so that when 
            thermal mass is zero all heat wi convective --none radiative.
            For this, I had to go through the code adding TMassCheck all over the 
            place. Not easy!!! So I think for now CoolVent is up and running. Ready
            for implementations but good with respect to debugging.

2008 12 04--CoolVent now interploates wind velocity as well. All this under the effort 
            to understand where strange stepchanges on airflow output come from... 
            I have not found the answer to such mystery yet.

2008 12 06--Window transmittance: 
            Uncoated double galzing CLR CLR T = 0.6. HoF Chap 30.

2009 05 18--Back to the hedious bug of Singular matrix in Cross Ventilation.
            Somehow, CoolVent only runs for certain combinations of cities and
            building heights (bizarre).
            I've changed the function Initializeflowrate (in DefinNetwork) by 
            simply initializing all flowrates with the value of 1e-10.

---         Code changed to read epw files

20090726  --I think I finally solved the cross ventilation problem. The model
            used to calculate the wind pressure coefficient gave wrong results.
            It would give negative Cp for opposing walls, leading to zero flow.
            This Cp was highly dependent on the building dimensions and wind direction, 
            hence the weird errors I was getting.
            I have implemented a new model, by Swami and Chandra, which has been
            widely validated.
            So far, it now seems it's be working fine.
          --Marcel has been working on the interface. It is the interface now that reads 
            the weather data and processes it. This end of CoolVent only reads
            it off the Outdoor.txt.
            Also, we removed the disNW and disWE lines from the Input.txt file. 
            Now I calculate it directly in InputRead.
