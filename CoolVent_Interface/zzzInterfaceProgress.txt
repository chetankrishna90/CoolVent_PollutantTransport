MAMB fixed Puerto Rico bug. The wind rose was not allowing for the option of "no occurrences" happening in a certain wind direction, and was dividing by zero.
MAMB Weather feedback was not correct, I fixed it.

20100315 MAMB fixed wind directions on wind rose.
MAMB added steady state wind rose.
MAMB results: 	disabled animate and play/pause button in steady
		transient goes to animate directly
		steady goes to the final line (I think) of results directly
MAMB tabs: steady and transient are "disabled" when they can't be used, and a message pops up when they try to access the worng tab
