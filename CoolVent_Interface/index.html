<h2> Formatted Report Examples </h2>

<p>
This is the final paper for the Advanced Computational Photography Course I took this term. All of
the figures/graphics were designed by me. The paper, written by myself and Tony Valderrama, follows the CVPR formatting.
</p>

</p>


<p>
This is my MOSCAP report for 6.152J, Micro/Nano Processing Technology (Spring 2009). It follows IEEE
formatting.

<h2> Unformatted Report and Problem Set Examples </h2>

<p>
This is my final report for Digital 'Death' Lab. It fully outlines the design of our version of
guitar hero.

</p>

<p>
This is an example of one of my pset writeups for Advanced Computational Photography (6.815). It
includes a lot of MATLAB code for submission purposes but there are also some examples of visual
outputs I coded up for the problem set through MATLAB.

<h2> Presentation Examples </h2>

<p>
This is my final presentation for 6.UAT, the course 6 undergrad thesis preparation course. I gave a
presentation on a possible extension for my final project for Digital 'Death' Lab (6.111).
</p>

<p>
This is my final presentation for the Hodgkin Huxley Model and our examination of the external sodium
concentrations effect on refractory period of the unmylenated giant squid axon.
</p>

<p>
